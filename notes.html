Joseph Smith was told to go back to where the plates were on September 22, 1823-1827
What did Aaron have?
-a breastplate. It wasn't like a huge warrior breastplate for war, it was referred to as the breastplate of judgment or the Urim and Thummim.
JSH 1:42
-Joseph is not supposed to show the stones that were set in the breastplate to anyone he is not directly commanded to show. So there are very few witnesses about what they actually look like.
What should we acknowledge about a lot of gospel art portraying the translation process?
  -that it's art and it's not necessarily historically accurate.
Who were the three main scribes for the BOM?
  -Emma, Martin Harris, Oliver Cowdery.
Restorations of Priesthood Keys and Authority

-D&C 6:25; how did God refer to the Urim and Thumim?
  -as keys
-Who were the two primary families that were witnesses to the BoM?
-the Smiths and the Whitmers. That was because Joseph showed it to those who really helped him.
-Three ways the BoM is the keystone:
  -witness
  -testimony 
  -doctrine
-keystones of our doctrine (all of which are found in the BoM):
  -God our father
  -creation
  -fall

Emma helped scribe the translation of the Bible as well.
What was it that was restored in the translation of the Bible?

  </p>
  <p>
2/27/18
Every spirit in the eternal world can be ferreted out and saved unless he has committed that unpardonable sin. -JS
Lucifer came out in open rebellion against God.
Luc means light in Latin.
What are secret combinations?
-Secret combinations are when Satan influenced others to kill their father and take his place. Like Satan did in the premortal life.
Denying the Holy Ghost is the unpardonable sin. But it's not because God is unwilling to forgive, it's because the offender is incapable of repenting.

The school of the prophets was held in the back room of the Newel K. Whitney store. It also held the church office of sorts, and a kitchen for Emma.
*Three purposes of the school of the prophets (they called it the house of God):
  -ensure that they understood the doctrine of the church (education---BYU)
  -to enable them to be effective missionaries. (---MTC)
  -they would wash feet to be cleansed of sins (sanctuary for ordinances---Provo temple)
Anotio Lebolo was an archeologist. Pyramids are in the northern part of Egypt. Land of the living was by the Nile, land of the dead was in the West away from water. Kings were buried there, and lesser kings in the land of the Nobles. Lebolo found his mummies and papyrus there.
Canopic jars are to store organs or mummies. They represent the four corners of the earth.
Joseph gives the explanation of the symbols in the facsimiles; he's telling us what the symbols mean.

3/13/18
-D&C 121:46; there's something about a scepter; a 'was scepter'. Represents power and authority.
The eye of Horus represents resurrection.
-he said that the eye of Horus is a numerical representation; each part is a fraction. All parts added together = 63/64; they understand that they can be resurrected but they recognize that there is a part of it that is out of their power.
In the hieroglyphs, there are many instances of people raising their hand to the square and making covenants with 'Hem'; which mean that they would be able to have children after life.
